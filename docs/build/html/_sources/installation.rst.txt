Installation
============


Compiling the low-level library
--------------------------------

Although Fieldosophy is a Python package, much of its functionality is based on lower level functions written in C and C++. 
These are packaged into a dynamically linked library that needs to be compiled before installing the package.

Before compiling this library some third-party libraries hves to be installed on your system. These are:

* Eigen 
    Can be downloaded from: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org.
    Once installed, go to the "Makefile"-file in the main directory of Fieldosophy and point the variable "EIGENPATH" to the location of the "Eigen" directory of the Eigen library.
* GNU Scientific library
    Can be downloaded from: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl. 
    Make sure to install it so that the libraries and headers are available in the default search paths of the compiler.

When these libraries are installed and set up, compile the Fieldosophy library by typing "make" in the main directory of the Fieldosophy package. 
The library-file should now reside in the "./fieldosophy/libraries" directory.

Installing the Python package
------------------------------

If Fieldosophy's low-level library has been compiled successfully and resides in the "./fieldosophy/libraries" directory, the Python package can be installed by typing: "pip install .".
Fieldosophy is now installed and can be imported in python using "import fieldosophy".

If you want to make sure that the installation is working properly you can type "python -m unittest". This will execute the suite of unit tests to confirm the installation.
